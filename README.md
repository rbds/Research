MATLAB: -> DP (Dynamic Programming) -> sparse_DP: current algorithm, work-in-progress
  Latest algorithm is in MATLAB> DP (Dynamic Programming) -> sparse_DP: (work-in-progress)
  It uses a dynamic programming algorithm to find the best path from each grid cell in a map to the target cell. The cost         function is set up to minimize total energy usage.
